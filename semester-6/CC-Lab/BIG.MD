### **EXERCISE 1: Install VirtualBox & Linux Mint**

**Aim**: To install VirtualBox, a powerful virtualization software, and then set up a Linux operating system (Linux Mint) within a virtual machine. This allows you to run a separate operating system within your current one.

**Detailed Steps:**

1.  **Download VirtualBox:**
    * Open your web browser and navigate to [https://www.virtualbox.org](https://www.virtualbox.org).
    * Look for the "Downloads" section on the website.
    * Click on the link corresponding to your host operating system (e.g., Windows hosts, macOS hosts, Linux distributions).
    * The download of the VirtualBox installer will begin.

2.  **Install VirtualBox:**
    * Once the download is complete, locate the installer file (e.g., a `.exe` file on Windows, a `.dmg` file on macOS, or a `.deb` file on Linux).
    * Double-click the installer to begin the installation process.
    * Follow the on-screen instructions. In most cases, the default settings are sufficient for a basic installation. You might be prompted to confirm the installation of network interfaces; it's generally safe to allow this.
    * Click "Next," "Install," and "Finish" as prompted.

3.  **Download Linux Mint ISO:**
    * Open your web browser and go to \[[https://linuxmint.com/download.php](https://linuxmint.com/download.php)].
    * You will see different editions of Linux Mint (e.g., Cinnamon, MATE, XFCE). For beginners, Cinnamon is often recommended due to its user-friendly interface.
    * Click on the download link for your preferred edition. You will be redirected to a list of mirrors. Choose a mirror geographically close to you for faster download speeds.
    * The download of the Linux Mint ISO file (e.g., `linuxmint-21.3-cinnamon-64bit.iso`) will start. This is a bootable image of the operating system.

4.  **Open VirtualBox and Create a New Virtual Machine:**
    * Launch the VirtualBox application that you just installed.
    * In the VirtualBox Manager window, click on the **"New"** button (it usually looks like a blue star or a plus sign).
    * A "Create Virtual Machine" dialog box will appear.
    * **Name:** Enter a descriptive name for your virtual machine, such as `Mint22` (you can choose any name you like).
    * **Type:** From the dropdown menu, select **"Linux"**.
    * **Version:** From the dropdown menu, select **"Ubuntu (64-bit)"**. Linux Mint is based on Ubuntu, so this is the correct selection for most modern Mint versions.
    * Click **"Next"**.

5.  **Set Memory Size:**
    * The next screen allows you to allocate RAM (Random Access Memory) to your virtual machine.
    * The recommended minimum is usually displayed. For a good experience with Linux Mint, it's recommended to allocate at least **2048 MB (2 GB)**.
    * You can increase this if your host computer has more available RAM. Be careful not to allocate too much, as it can slow down your host operating system. The green area on the slider usually indicates a safe range.
    * Click **"Next"**.

6.  **Create Virtual Hard Disk:**
    * The next screen deals with the virtual hard disk where Linux Mint will be installed.
    * Select the option **"Create a virtual hard disk now"** (it should be the default).
    * Click **"Create"**.
    * You will be prompted to choose the hard disk file type. Select **"VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)"**. This is the native format for VirtualBox. Click **"Next"**.
    * Choose the storage on the physical hard disk. Select **"Dynamically allocated"**. This means the virtual hard disk file will only take up as much space on your physical drive as it actually uses, up to the maximum size you specify. **"Fixed size"** allocates the entire space upfront. Dynamically allocated is generally preferred for flexibility. Click **"Next"**.
    * Specify the size of the virtual hard disk. **25 GB** is a recommended minimum for a basic Linux Mint installation with some room for software. You can allocate more if you plan to install many applications or store large files within the VM.
    * Choose the location where you want to save the virtual hard disk file. The default location is usually fine.
    * Click **"Create"**.

7.  **Mount the Linux Mint ISO:**
    * In the VirtualBox Manager, select the `Mint22` virtual machine you just created from the list on the left.
    * Click on the **"Settings"** button (it usually looks like a gear icon).
    * In the "Settings" dialog, navigate to the **"Storage"** tab.
    * Under the "Controller: IDE" or "Controller: SATA" section, you should see an entry labeled **"Empty"** next to an icon that looks like a CD/DVD drive. Select this "Empty" entry.
    * On the right side, under "Attributes," click on the dropdown menu next to **"Optical Drive"**.
    * Select **"Choose a disk file..."**.
    * Browse to the location where you downloaded the Linux Mint ISO file and select it. Click **"Open"**.
    * Click **"OK"** to close the "Settings" dialog.

8.  **Start the Virtual Machine and Install Linux Mint:**
    * In the VirtualBox Manager, select the `Mint22` virtual machine again.
    * Click on the **"Start"** button (it usually looks like a green arrow).
    * The virtual machine will boot up from the Linux Mint ISO file. You will likely see a boot menu.
    * Use your arrow keys to select **"Start Linux Mint"** (or a similar option) and press **Enter**.
    * The Linux Mint live environment will load. You can try it out before installing.
    * On the desktop, you should see an icon labeled **"Install Linux Mint"**. Double-click this icon to begin the installation process.
    * Follow the on-screen installation steps:
        * **Language:** Choose your preferred language.
        * **Keyboard Layout:** Select your keyboard layout. You can test it to ensure it's correct.
        * **Multimedia Codecs:** It's usually a good idea to check the box to install multimedia codecs for better media support.
        * **Installation Type:** Select **"Erase disk and install Linux Mint"**. **Be absolutely sure you have selected the virtual hard disk** you created earlier. This will only affect the virtual disk, not your host computer's hard drive.
        * **Timezone:** Select your timezone (Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India).
        * **Who are you?** Enter your name, a computer name for the virtual machine, a username, and a strong password. Remember these credentials as you will need them to log in.
        * The installation process will begin. This may take some time.
        * Once the installation is complete, you will be prompted to **"Restart Now"**. Click this button.
        * The virtual machine might tell you to remove the installation medium (the ISO file). To do this in VirtualBox, go to **Devices > Optical Drives > Remove disk from virtual drive**. Then press **Enter** in the virtual machine window to continue the reboot.
        * The virtual machine will now boot into your newly installed Linux Mint operating system. Log in using the username and password you created during the installation.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed VirtualBox and set up a Linux Mint virtual machine.

### **EXERCISE 2: Install a C Compiler and Run a Sample Program**

**Aim**: To install the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), which includes the `g++` C++ compiler, on your Linux Mint virtual machine and then compile and run a simple C++ program.

**Detailed Steps:**

1.  **Open Terminal:**
    * Once you are logged into your Linux Mint virtual machine, open the Terminal application. You can usually find it in the menu (often under "Accessories" or by searching for "Terminal").

2.  **Update Package Lists:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
    * This command updates the package lists from the software repositories. It's essential to run this before installing new software to ensure you have the latest information about available packages. You will be prompted to enter your password (the one you set during the Linux Mint installation).

3.  **Install build-essential:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install build-essential -y
    ```
    * The `build-essential` package is a meta-package that includes many essential tools for compiling software, including the GCC compiler (`gcc` for C and `g++` for C++), make, and other necessary utilities.
    * The `sudo` command allows you to run commands with administrator privileges.
    * The `-y` flag automatically answers "yes" to any prompts during the installation, so you don't have to manually confirm.

4.  **Create a C++ Source File:**
    ```bash
    nano welcome.cpp
    ```
    * This command uses the `nano` text editor to create a new file named `welcome.cpp`. If `nano` is not installed, you can use another text editor like `gedit`.

5.  **Paste the C++ Code:**
    * The `nano` editor will open. Carefully type or paste the following C++ code into the editor:
    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;
    int main() {
        cout << "Hello world" << endl;
        return 0;
    }
    ```
    * **`#include <iostream>`:** This line includes the iostream library, which provides input and output functionalities, including `cout` for printing to the console.
    * **`using namespace std;`:** This line brings the standard namespace into scope, allowing you to use elements like `cout` directly without the `std::` prefix.
    * **`int main() { ... }`:** This is the main function where the program execution begins.
    * **`cout << "Hello world" << endl;`:** This line uses `cout` to print the string "Hello world" to the standard output (your terminal). `endl` inserts a newline character, moving the cursor to the next line.
    * **`return 0;`:** This indicates that the program has executed successfully.

6.  **Save and Exit:**
    * To save the file in `nano`, press **Ctrl + O** (write out). You will be prompted to confirm the filename; press **Enter**.
    * To exit `nano`, press **Ctrl + X**.

7.  **Compile the C++ Program:**
    ```bash
    g++ -Wall -o welcome welcome.cpp
    ```
    * **`g++`:** This is the command-line C++ compiler that was installed as part of `build-essential`.
    * **`-Wall`:** This flag enables all common compiler warnings. It's good practice to use this to catch potential issues in your code.
    * **`-o welcome`:** This option specifies the name of the output executable file. In this case, the compiled program will be named `welcome`. If you omit this, the default output filename on Linux is usually `a.out`.
    * **`welcome.cpp`:** This is the name of the source code file you created.
    * This command takes your `welcome.cpp` file and compiles it into an executable file named `welcome`.

8.  **Run the Executable:**
    ```bash
    ./welcome
    ```
    * **`./`:** This indicates that the executable file is in the current directory. You need to include this because the system's PATH environment variable usually doesn't include the current directory for security reasons.
    * **`welcome`:** This is the name of the executable file that was created in the previous step.
    * Press **Enter** to execute the program.

9.  **Expected Output:**
    ```
    Hello world
    ```
    * If everything worked correctly, you should see the output "Hello world" printed in your terminal.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed a C++ compiler and run a sample program on your Linux Mint virtual machine.
