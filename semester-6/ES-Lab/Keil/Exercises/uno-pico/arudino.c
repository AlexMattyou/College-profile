Okay, let's break down the Arduino and Raspberry Pi Pico codes provided for your Bluetooth communication experiment, following the clear structure you liked.

âœ… Experiment 9: Communicate Between Arduino and Raspberry Pi (via Bluetooth) Explanation
ðŸŽ¯ Aim:

To send data wirelessly from Arduino to Raspberry Pi Pico using Bluetooth (HC-05).

ðŸ”Œ Connections:

ðŸ”· HC-05 to Arduino

HC-05 Pin	Arduino Pin	Notes
VCC	5V	Power supply for the HC-05 module.
GND	GND	Ground connection.
TXD	Pin 2	Transmit pin of HC-05 connected to RX pin of Arduino.
RXD	Pin 3	Receive pin of HC-05 connected to TX pin of Arduino through a voltage divider (important because HC-05 TX is 3.3V and Arduino RX is 5V tolerant, but it's good practice to level shift).
