1. Write a Python script to compute cosine similarity between users' movie ratings.
(100).
2.Identify the most similar user to a target user based on their preferences using Jaccard
similarity. (100)
3.Perform PCA on a given user-item matrix and visualize the top 2 principal components.
(100)
4.Implement SVD for dimensionality reduction and use it to predict missing entries in a sparse
matrix. (100)
5.Create a user profile vector by aggregating item features based on user interaction data.
(100)
6.Build a content-based recommender system using TF-IDF to analyze item descriptions and
recommend similar items. (100)
7.Train a machine learning model (e.g., k-NN) using item features to recommend similar items
to users. (100)
8.Evaluate the performance of a user-based collaborative filtering model using precision and
recall. (100)
9.Simulate a shilling attack by injecting fake user profiles to bias the recommendations of a
target item. (100)
10.Develop a detection algorithm to identify malicious users in a manipulated dataset.
(100)
11.Implement a function to compute and plot the ROC curve for a given recommender system.
(100)
12.Develop a program to recommend songs based on their metadata (e.g., artist, genre, and
year). (100)
13.Build a feature matrix for movies using both genres and actors, and implement a
content-based recommender. (100)
14.Write a Python program to calculate the top-5 recommendations for a user using Pearson
correlation. (100)
15. Write a Python program to calculate the top-5 recommendations for a user using Pearson
correlation. (100)
16. Implement both offline and online evaluation metrics for recommender systems.
i) Choose a dataset (e.g., MovieLens, Netflix). (50)
ii ) Implement common offline metrics (e.g., RMSE, Precision, Recall) and assess the
performance of a baseline recommender system. (50)
17. Investigate and mitigate bias in recommender systems to ensure fairness in the
recommendations.
i) Use a dataset where you can observe potential biases (e.g., gender, age, or region-based
biases in recommendations). (50)
ii) Implement a basic collaborative filtering or content-based recommender system. (50)
18. Implement a context-aware recommender system that incorporates contextual information
(such as time of day, user location, or device type) into the recommendation process.
i) Use a dataset that contains contextual information (e.g., ratings with time stamps,
location data). (50)
ii) Modify a collaborative filtering or content-based model to incorporate the context in the
recommendation process. (50)
19. Develop a recommender system using implicit feedback (such as clicks, views, or
purchases) rather than explicit feedback (such as ratings).
i) Use a dataset that includes implicit feedback (e.g., user clicks, purchase history, or
movie views). (50)
ii) Implement an implicit feedback model (e.g., matrix factorization techniques like ALS or
techniques for implicit feedback datasets). (50)
20. Implement a cross-domain recommender system that can recommend items across different
domains (e.g., recommending movies based on a userâ€™s book preferences).
i) Use datasets from different domains (e.g., MovieLens for movies, Goodreads for books).
(50)
ii) Develop a cross-domain recommender system that transfers knowledge or recommendations
from one domain to another. (50)
